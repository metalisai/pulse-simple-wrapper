# PulseAudio wrapper

## What is this?

PulseAudio wrapper for very simple recording and playback streams.  
I used it for simple interop with C# code.  
Needed it because all existing C# audio libraries seemed to use ALSA which doesn't seem to play nice with some applications when you need to route audio manually.
